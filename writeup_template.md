**Vehicle Detection Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier
* Optionally, you can also apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to your HOG feature vector. 
* Note: for those first two steps don't forget to normalize your features and randomize a selection for training and testing.
* Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.
* Run your pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.
* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.

### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  [Here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Vehicle-Detection/blob/master/writeup_template.md) is a template writeup for this project you can use as a guide and a starting point.  

You're reading it!

### Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)

#### 1. Explain how (and identify where in your code) you extracted HOG features from the training images.

The code for this step is contained in the first code cell of the IPython notebook (or in lines # through # of the file called `some_file.py`).  

I started by reading in all the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` images.  Here is an example of one of each of the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` classes:

I then explored different color spaces and different `skimage.hog()` parameters (`orientations`, `pixels_per_cell`, and `cells_per_block`).  I grabbed random images from each of the two classes and displayed them to get a feel for what the `skimage.hog()` output looks like.

Here is an example using the `YCrCb` color space and HOG parameters of `orientations=8`, `pixels_per_cell=(8, 8)` and `cells_per_block=(2, 2)`:

#### 2. Explain how you settled on your final choice of HOG parameters.

I settled on my final choice of HOG parameters based upon the performance of the SVM classifier produced using them. I considered not only the accuracy with which the classifier made predictions on the test dataset, but also the speed at which the classifier is able to make predictions. There is a balance to be struck between accuracy and speed of the classifier, and my strategy was to bias toward speed first, and achieve as close to real-time predictions as possible, and then pursue accuracy if the detection pipeline were not to perform satisfactorily.

#### 3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you trained a classifier using your selected HOG features (and color features if you used them).

In the section titled "Train a Classifier" I trained a linear SVM with the default classifier parameters and using HOG features alone (I did not use spatial intensity or channel intensity histogram features) and was able to achieve a test accuracy of 98.17%

### Sliding Window Search

#### 1. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented a sliding window search.  How did you decide what scales to search and how much to overlap windows?

In the section titled "Method for Using Classifier to Detect Cars in an Image" I adapted the method find_cars from the lesson materials. The method combines HOG feature extraction with a sliding window search, but rather than perform feature extraction on each window individually which can be time consuming, the HOG features are extracted for the entire image (or a selected portion of it) and then these full-image features are subsampled according to the size of the window and then fed to the classifier. The method performs the classifier prediction on the HOG features for each window region and returns a list of rectangle objects corresponding to the windows that generated a positive ("car") prediction.

The final algorithm calls find_cars for each window scale and the rectangles returned from each method call are aggregated. In previous implementations smaller (0.5) scales were explored but found to return too many false positives, and originally the window overlap was set to 50% in both X and Y directions, but an overlap of 75% in the Y direction (yet still 50% in the X direction) produced more redundant true positive detections, which were preferable given the heatmap strategy described below. Additionally, only an appropriate vertical range of the image is considered for each window size (e.g. smaller range for smaller scales) to reduce the chance for false positives in areas where cars at that scale are unlikely to appear. The final implementation considers 190 window locations, which proved to be robust enough to reliably detect vehicles while maintaining a high speed of execution.

The image below shows the rectangles returned by find_cars drawn onto one of the test images in the final implementation. Notice that there are several positive predictions on each of the near-field cars, and one positive prediction on a car in the oncoming lane.

#### 2. Show some examples of test images to demonstrate how your pipeline is working.  What did you do to optimize the performance of your classifier?

Ultimately I searched on two scales using YCrCb 3-channel HOG features plus spatially binned color and histograms of color in the feature vector, which provided a nice result.  Here are some example images:

### Video Implementation

#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (somewhat wobbly or unstable bounding boxes are ok as long as you are identifying the vehicles most of the time with minimal false positives.)
Here's a [link to my video result](./project_video_output.mp4)


#### 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented some kind of filter for false positives and some method for combining overlapping bounding boxes.

I recorded the positions of positive detections in each frame of the video.  From the positive detections I created a heatmap and then thresholded that map to identify vehicle positions.  I then used `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` to identify individual blobs in the heatmap.  I then assumed each blob corresponded to a vehicle.  I constructed bounding boxes to cover the area of each blob detected.  

Here's an example result showing the heatmap from a series of frames of video, the result of `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` and the bounding boxes then overlaid on the last frame of video:

### Here are six frames and their corresponding heatmaps:

### Here is the output of `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` on the integrated heatmap from all six frames:

### Discussion

#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

The problems that I faced while implementing this project were mainly concerned with detection accuracy. Balancing the accuracy of the classifier with execution speed was crucial. Scanning 190 windows using a classifier that achieves 98% accuracy should result in around 4 misidentified windows per frame. Of course, integrating detections from previous frames mitigates the effect of the misclassifications, but it also introduces another problem: vehicles that significantly change position from one frame to the next (e.g. oncoming traffic) will tend to escape being labeled. Producing a very high accuracy classifier and maximizing window overlap might improve the per-frame accuracy to the point that integrating detections from previous frames is unnecessary (and oncoming traffic is correctly labeled), but it would also be far from real-time without massive processing power.

The pipeline is probably most likely to fail in cases where vehicles (or the HOG features thereof) don't resemble those in the training dataset, but lighting and environmental conditions might also play a role (e.g. a white car against a white background). As stated above, oncoming cars are an issue, as well as distant cars (as mentioned earlier, smaller window scales tended to produce more false positives, but they also did not often correctly label the smaller, distant cars).

I believe that the best approach, given plenty of time to pursue it, would be to combine a very high accuracy classifier with high overlap in the search windows.
